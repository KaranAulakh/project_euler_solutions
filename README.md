# Project Euler Solutions

A personal workspace for working through and saving Project Euler problems. This repository serves as a learning journal where I explore mathematical concepts, implement solutions, and document my thought process.

## Purpose

This repository is primarily a space to:
- **Work through** Project Euler problems systematically
- **Save and organize** solutions for future reference
- **Explore** different approaches (brute force → optimized)
- **Learn** mathematical principles and algorithms
- **Document** problem-solving methodologies

Running solutions is a secondary convenience - the main value is in the exploration and learning process.

## Structure

```
euler/
├── main.py              # Simple runner
└── Promblems/           # Problem solutions organized by number
    ├── 1.py
    ├── 2.py
    └── ...
```


## Running Solutions (Optional)

If you want to quickly run a solution:

```bash
python main.py <problem_number>
```

Example:
```bash
python main.py 1
python main.py 2
```
